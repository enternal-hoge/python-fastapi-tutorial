# python-fastapi-tutorial

I tried python fastapi.
The reason is not to develop a REST API service using python. 

The purpose is to create a mock quickly and create a REST API specification quickly.

I feel that fastapi is better than JSON Server. Also, I use fastapi when writing REST APIs in Python.
